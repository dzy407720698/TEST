Explain Potential Problems

Identify EMAIL ADDRESS, WEB ADDRESS, DOLLAR AMOUNT, DATE and TIME in order.

EMAIL ADDRESS: do not know the exact specific standard of email address, too many edge cases.

WEB ADDRESS: do not know the exact standard of web address (should not match any single word).

DOLLAR AMOUNT: can identify e.g. 'one-thousand-and-three-hundred dollars' but cannot identify 'one thousand and three hundred dollars'.

DATE: Do not identify 4-digit number as year because it is hard to tell. E.g., 'in 2019 books' and 'in 2019'.

TIME: Do not identify 2-digit number as time and cannot identify two successive words that represent time because it is hard to tell. E.g., 'meet you at 12' and '12 girls', 'meet you at three thirty' and 'one million books'.
